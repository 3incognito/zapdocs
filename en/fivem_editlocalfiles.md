## 📔 Overview

First of all we have to connect to the server.
Here you can find the instructions for this ![](https://zap-hosting.com/guides/docs/de/gameserver_ftpaccess/)

## 📑 Find Locales Files
Once we have done that we look for the script where we want to change the local files.

There we search for the orderer **locales**.

If we have changed everything we wanted to change, we save the file and upload it.
