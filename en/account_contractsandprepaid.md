## ðŸ“š Contracts & Prepaids
Logged in to your ZAP hosting account you will find the menu item "Contracts & Prepaids" on the left side. There all active servers are listed, but also expired servers that have not been deleted yet.

> **difference between contracts and prepaids**: Contracts are automatically renewed and must be terminated. Prepaids simply expire after the booked time, as long as they are not extended manually.


## ðŸ“™ My contracts
All server products for which you selected "**Contract**" as "**Billing type**" during the order process will automatically renew unless you cancel them.
